# COVID-19 self-assessment tool v3

This is the third iteration of the covid-19 self-assessment tool

## RUNNING

**NOTE:** You need to have an up-to-date version of NodeJS installed to run this. I used 13.3.0 for development but any version higher than 12.0.0 should work. You also might need to install `yarn` globally using `npm i -g yarn` before being able to run this project.

To run during development, simply use `yarn develop` command.

To run in production, run `yarn build` and once the build is completed copy the `public` folder to a server where the application will be hosted.
