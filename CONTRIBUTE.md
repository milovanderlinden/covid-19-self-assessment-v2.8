# Contribution guidelines

## Welcome!
We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an Ontario Digital Service (ODS) project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the ODS Code of Conduct and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's contributing policy (you are here), its [license](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).
